# Imperative programming, 2021 project : LR1 automatons

The goal of this project is to implement a program that executes LR(1) automata. These are used to recognize programming languages

# Compilation 

First, please go to the files directory

To compile the code, simply type the `make` command in the terminal

This command will create the executable named **lr_parser** 

# Execution 

After compilation, simply type the command `./lr_parser file.aut` in the terminal, where file.aut is the file containing information about the chosen automaton
